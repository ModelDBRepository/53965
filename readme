 Vitko I, Chen Y,Arias JM, Shen Y, Wu XR, Perez-Reyes E (2005) 
 Functional Characterization and Neuronal Modeling of the Effects of Childhood 
 Absence Epilepsy Variants of CACNA1H, a T-Type Calcium Channel 
 J Neurosci 25:4844-4855
 
 The models for this paper were made by modifying Alain Destexhe's
 thalamic reticular neuron model: Destexhe A, Contreras D, Steriade M, 
 Sejnowski TJ and Huguenard JR.  In vivo, in vitro and computational 
 analysis of dendritic calcium currents in thalamic reticular neurons.
 Journal of Neuroscience 16: 169-185, 1996.

 Three representative models are present for Vitko et al: wild-type (WT) 
 recombinant Cav3.2 T-channel, and two of the mutants described in the 
 Vitko et al, 2005 paper (C456S and R788C).
 
 These file were provided by Perez-Reyes.
 
 The auto-launch demo starts with the C456S channel.  The other channels can be
 accessed by downloading the archive, compiling the mod files with nrnivmodl 
(unix) or mknrndll (mac and mswin) and then double clicking on the 
mosinit.hoc file.  See the below directories readme files for more usage
information.

Details to reproduce Fig 7:  The model will need to downloaded and compiled as
per the above paragraph so that the wildtype and R788C mutant directories can 
each be accessed.  Start with the mosinit.hoc in either directory. Run
the model in:
	Burst in 3 compartment Model
	Current clamp
	Location dend1[1][1]
	delay off
	and then either:
	fig Aa	EPSP:  0.02 nA current injection for 100 ms
	fig Ba	IPSP: -0.1  nA current injection for 300 ms

7/12/2004 models updated to run with button presses of control panel (had
to be restarted earlier).
