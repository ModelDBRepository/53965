This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  http://neuron.duke.edu/

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed to
simulate different models of thalamic reticular (RE) neurons, relative to the
paper:

  In vivo, in vitro and computational analysis of dendritic calcium currents 
  in thalamic reticular neurons.  Journal of Neuroscience 16: 169-185, 1996.

  PROGRAMS
  ========

re1_cc.oc  : current clamp in one-compartment RE cell
re3_cc.oc  : current clamp in 3-compartment RE cell
re3_vc.oc  : voltage clamp in 3-compartment RE cell
re80_cc.oc : current clamp in 80-compartment RE cell
re80_vc.oc : voltage clamp in 80-compartment RE cell
reD_cc.oc  : current clamp in 8-compartment RE cell (dissociated cell)
reD_vc.oc  : voltage clamp in 8-compartment RE cell (dissociated cell)


  MECHANISMS
  ==========

 HH2.mod		: fast sodium spikes (Na and K currents)
 IT2.mod		: T-type calcium current of RE cells
 capump.mod		: intracellular calcium dynamics
 VClamp.mod		: mechanism for single-electrode voltage-clamp


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

  To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
  the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
  given in the mod files.

  Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

After either of the above platforms instructions: 

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on "Init and Run" button
or if appropriate ""Start protocol" for voltage clamp families, to start the simulation...
